PKGBUILD for https://github.com/BryanJacobs/fido2-hid-bridge.

Note: This installs the package and all dependencies in `/opt/fido2-hid-bridge`. That's not very optimal, but good enough for me as I have no idea about python packaging and just wanted to get this working â€“ if this isn't good enough for you, you need another solution, this won't fit.
